# Mechatronics Engineering
With 8+ years of experience in manufacturing and production environments, including electronics assembly, machinery operation, and process improvement. Skilled in IPC-compliant assembly, documentation, and quality control. Now based in Petone, I’m excited to contribute to a forward-thinking projects.

## KEY SKILLS 
- Prototyping & Troubleshooting
- CAD Design (SolidWorks, Ansys, AutoCAD)
- PCB Design (Altium Designer, KiCad, Eagle CAD)
- Lean Manufacturing (FMEA, RCA, SPC)
- Automation & Control systems (Festo FluidSim, SIMATIC S7, PLC Programming & Microcontroller)

## Projects
### MCAD for assembly instructions @ GPV Lanka
#### What?
Complex assembly instructions on paper is harder for operators to completely understand.
Create interactive visual work instruction for each process step
#### How?
Used **SolidWorks composer** to model complex assembly.
Using **Aegis’ Factory Logix MES** created step-by-step animated assembly instructions.
#### Results
Reduced training and skill requirements for new operators.
Reduced delay and cost due to assembly mistakes.

### FEA simulation for PCB Bending tool @ GPV Lanka
#### What?
Design a tool to bend the aluminum PCB 12˚inwards from both ends at a distance of 11mm.
Predict the requited tool angle to compensating for the spring back.
#### How?
Used **SolidWorks** to model the tool. 
Required tool angel was determined as 16˚ using FEA tools.
Press tool slipping during bending was identified, tool design was updated with guiding pins.
#### Results
Fabricated the tool according to simulation results.
The tool provided the required bend without damaging PCB surface.
Reduced material and time consumption for tool production and verification.
