# Mechatronics Engineering
With 8+ years of experience in manufacturing and production environments, including electronics assembly, machinery operation, and process improvement. Skilled in IPC-compliant assembly, documentation, and quality control. Now based in Petone, I’m excited to contribute to a forward-thinking projects.

## KEY SKILLS 
- Prototyping & Troubleshooting
- CAD Design (SolidWorks, Ansys, AutoCAD)
- PCB Design (Altium Designer, KiCad, Eagle CAD)
- Lean Manufacturing (FMEA, RCA, SPC)
- Automation & Control systems (Festo FluidSim, SIMATIC S7, PLC Programming & Microcontroller)

## Projects
### MCAD for assembly instructions @ GPV Lanka
##### What?
Complex assembly instructions on paper is harder for operators to completely understand. Create interactive visual work instruction for each process step.
##### How?
Used **SolidWorks composer** to model complex assembly. Using **Aegis’ Factory Logix MES** created step-by-step animated assembly instructions.
##### Results
Reduced training and skill requirements for new operators. Reduced delay and cost due to assembly mistakes.

### FEA simulation for PCB Bending tool @ GPV Lanka
#### What?
Design a tool to bend the aluminum PCB 12˚inwards from both ends at a distance of 11mm. Predict the requited tool angle to compensating for the spring back.
#### How?
Used **SolidWorks** to model the tool. 
Required tool angel was determined as 16˚ using FEA tools. Press tool slipping during bending was identified, tool design was updated with guiding pins.
#### Results
Fabricated the tool according to simulation results. The tool provided the required bend without damaging PCB surface. Reduced material and time consumption for tool production and verification.
### statistical process control @ GPV Lanka
#### What?
Statistical process control for continuous improvement. Determine how raw material parameter change effect end product FPY 
#### How?
Gather material, process, environment and product test result data. Use data analysis tools like **Minitab** to determine correlation. Use SPC to measures and controls quality.
 #### Results
Improving product quality and consistency, reducing waste and rework. Enhancing productivity and efficiency and supporting continuous improvement and innovation.
### lean Production layout @ GPV Lanka
#### What?
Production layout change according to material flow. Spaghetti diagram for current layout. Predict the optimal layout for available space.
#### How?
Cread digital CAD drawing of the complete area. Arrange production sections according to material flow.
 #### Results
