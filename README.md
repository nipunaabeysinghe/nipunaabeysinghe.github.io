## Projects
### Interactive Assembly Instructions – Pilot Project | GPV Lanka
Designed and implemented interactive step-by-step assembly instructions for complex PCB, cable, and mechanical housing assemblies using SolidWorks Composer and Aegis FactoryLogix MES. Instructions were displayed on touchscreen stations in the mechanical assembly area, guiding operators visually through each process including precise part placement and torque specs. As the project lead, I created 3D mechanical models and integrated them into the MES system. The pilot reduced training needs and minimized assembly errors, demonstrating the potential of MES-driven visual workflows.

### FEA-Based PCB Bending Tool Design | GPV Lanka
As the NPI engineer, designed and simulated a manual bending tool to meet product requirements for a 12° inward bend on aluminum PCBs. Used SolidWorks and FEA to determine a 16° tool angle to account for spring-back, and updated the design with guide pins to prevent slipping. The tool was successfully fabricated and deployed in production, achieving accurate bends without surface damage and reducing development time and material use.

### Statistical Process Control – Transformer Manufacturing | GPV Lanka
Led SPC initiatives to enhance first pass yield (FPY) in the production of transformers. Collected and analyzed process, material, and environmental data—including ferrite core AL values, wire and core lot traceability, and epoxy curing conditions—using Minitab and statistical tools. Conducted experiments to identify root causes of FPY variation. This resulted in improved product quality, reduced rework, and more efficient fault identification and resolution.

### Digital Layout Redesign with visTABLE – Transformer Production | GPV Lanka
Led the redesign of the transformer production layout using visTABLE to support lean manufacturing and digital planning initiatives. Utilized CAD-based modeling and spaghetti diagram analysis to optimize operator and material flow across the production floor. The implemented layout reduced movement between operations, improved space utilization, and contributed to the company’s digital transformation toward data-driven factory planning.
