# Mechatronics Engineering
With 8+ years of experience in manufacturing and production environments, including electronics assembly, machinery operation, and process improvement. Skilled in IPC-compliant assembly, documentation, and quality control. Now based in Petone, I’m excited to contribute to a forward-thinking projects.

## KEY SKILLS 
- Prototyping & Troubleshooting
- CAD Design (SolidWorks, Ansys, AutoCAD)
- PCB Design (Altium Designer, KiCad, Eagle CAD)
- Lean Manufacturing (FMEA, RCA, SPC)
- Automation & Control systems (Festo FluidSim, SIMATIC S7, PLC Programming & Microcontroller)

## Projects
### MCAD for assembly instructions - GPV Lanka
#### What?
Complex assembly instructions on paper is harder for operators to completely understand.
Create interactive visual work instruction for each process step
### How?
Used SolidWorks composer to model complex assembly.
Using Aegis’ Factory Logix MES created step-by-step animated assembly instructions.
### Results
Reduced training and skill requirements for new operators.
Reduced delay and cost due to assembly mistakes.
